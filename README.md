# CreativeTechPersonalProject: Future Plant Fossils
This project has to do with how contemporary people experience plant fossils and how post-humans will learn about current plants through future plant fossils. In my idea, the future plant fossils will be virtual, and by recording the genes of plants in a database and restoring the form, colour and growing environment of plants, it will provoke people to think about the current ecological environment and plant conservation.

## References
In my preliminary research for this project, I found that current scientists have no basis for the colour, hair or form of animals and plants based on fossils, or they can only guess based on the surrounding growing environment. Therefore, for this project, I have modified the shape and colour of the plants and the shape and colour of the fruits. Therefore, this project envisions that in the future, due to the mutation of plants due to environmental pollution, human beings make guesses about the plants they see based on the genes of the plants in the database, thus triggering people to think about the ecological environment.

## Self-guided Exploration
Personally, I love plants and I hope that I can realize people's reflections on the current ecology through design language and technology. I think people have long viewed plants as a service provider, whereas in design, people are more concerned with human-centred design, exploiting the value that plants bring, and plants are also seen as unconscious. But I think the value of all life is the same, and I would like to see more focus on plant-centered design.

## Technology
For this project, I tried using AR for the first time. I first modelled the plant in Blender and added the rotation animation. After rendering I imported the 120 fps image into After Effects to convert it to video with a transparency channel. The video was then imported into Artivive along with the information about the plant in Illustrator to create AR. I chose AR because I think it's a fun and interactive way to break up the way people get information in 2D space. By scanning the fossils and posters on the wall, people can see more realistic plants on the screen and get more, detailed information.
